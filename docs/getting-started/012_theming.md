This step consists in introducing **`onekijs-ui`** which is a library that provides many components. Some of them are very complex like a data table with infinite scrolling.<br/>
In order to have a consistent look and feel (consistent color, padding, marging, ...), the style of these components is centralized in a customizable theme.

In this step we present how the theme works and how we can use it to update the look and feel of our website.<br/>
In the next step, we will introduce some of the components provided by  **`onekijs-ui`**

:::caution
To style the components, **`onekijs-ui`** uses the **[styled components](https://styled-components.com/)** library. It's *strongly* recommended to learn this library !
:::


## Final result

The result of this step is as follows:

:::info New in this step
The background color of the `<Navbar />` is from the theme<br/>
The font family is also from the theme
:::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="cra">
    <Sandbox
    name="step10-service"
    type="getting-started/cra"
    view="preview"
    height="600"
    modules={['/src/index.tsx','/src/pages/products/index.tsx']}
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="next">
    <Sandbox
      name="step10-service"
      type="getting-started/next"
      view="preview"
      height="600"
      modules={['/src/pages/index.tsx','/src/pages/_app.tsx']}
      />
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Adding onekijs-ui to the project
**`onekijs-ui`** is a standalone library. So we have to add it to the project

```
yarn add onekijs-ui
```
Once the library is added, the entrypoint (`index.tsx`) must be updated to wrap all components in a theme

:::info
We use `<ClarityTheme />` which is a theme provided by **`onekijs-ui`**. This theme implements the **[Clarity Design System](https://clarity.design)** from VMware<br/>
You can have a look at all the parameters defining the theme **[here](https://github.com/oneki/onekijs/blob/master/packages/onekijs-ui/src/theme/clarity.tsx)**<br/><br/>
**`onekijs-ui`** allows you to build your own theme from scratch or extend an existing theme to adapt it.

## Theme colors
We want to update the navbar so the background color is coming from the theme and not from `style.css`<br/>
Concerning the colors, **Onekijs-ui** is inspired by [Bootstrap[](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/bootstrap_colors.php) and a theme defines several ones:

| name | Description
| ---- | -----------
| **primary** | The main color. Generally used for important element like a submit button
| **secondary** | The second main color. Generally used for less important element
| **success** | A color to represent a success
| **info** | A color to represnet some information
| **warning** | A color to indicate a warning
| **danger** | A color to indicate a danger / error
| **white** | white color
| **black** | black color
| **light** | a light color
| **lightest** | a very light color
| **dark** | a dark color
| **darkest** | a very dark color

This means that if a component defines its background color as `secondary`, the color will be the one identified by the key `secondary` in the theme.

:::info
Actually, more colors are defined by the theme, the list is available **[here](https://github.com/oneki/onekijs/blob/master/packages/onekijs-ui/src/theme/base.tsx)**
:::

:::note
The theme defines not only the colors but also the spacing, border radius, padding, ...
:::


## Upgrading the Navbar component
As we want to use a color coming from the theme, we can't use anymore `style.css` to define the background color of the `<Navbar/>`

Therefore, the first thing to do is to update `<Navbar>` to use a classname generated by **[styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)** instead of the classname defined in `style.css`

```tsx
import { FCC, ... } from 'onekijs';
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';

const Navbar: FCC = ({ className }) => { // FCC is like React.FC but add children and className to the props
  ...
  return (
    <div className={className}>
      ...
    </div>
  );
};
```

The prop `className` is injected by styled-components like this

```tsx
//instead of exporting the Navbar directly, we export the styled version
export default styled(Navbar)`
  // CSS HERE
`;
```

To define the style of the `<Navbar/>`, we could use standard CSS like this:

```tsx
import styled from 'styled-components';


export default styled(Navbar)`
  width: 100%;
  height: 68px;
  background-color: #1976d2;
  padding: 16px;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;

  h1 {
    color: white;
  }
`;
```

But we want to use the color from the theme and not an hardcoded one. <br/>
To achieve that, for each CSS property, **Onekijs-ui** provides a method that has access to the theme and therefore can reference a property in the theme

```tsx
import {
  alignItems,
  backgroundColor,
  color,
  display,
  flexDirection,
  height,
  justifyContent,
  padding,
  width,
} from 'onekijs-ui';
import styled from 'styled-components';


export default styled(Navbar)`
  ${backgroundColor('secondary')} // use the key 'secondary' from the theme to define the color
  ${width('100%')}
  ${height('68px')}
  ${padding('lg')} // use the key 'lg' from the theme to define the size
  ${display('flex')}
  ${flexDirection('row')}
  ${justifyContent('space-between')}
  ${alignItems('center')}

  h1 {
    ${color('white')}
  }
`;
```

<br/>

:::tip
the CSS methods provided by oneki (backgroundColor, width, ...) can do more that just retrieving a color from the theme<br/>

The final `<Navbar />` now looks like this

## Next step
The getting started tutorial is over. You should now have a good understanding of what Oneki.js can do to help you build enterprise applications !
