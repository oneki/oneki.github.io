```tsx
NativeReactDomRouter(__namedParameters: RouterProps): React.ReactElement | null
```
<br/>

Provides location context for the rest of the app.

Note: You usually won't render a <Router\> directly. Instead, you'll render a  
router that is more specific to your environment such as a <BrowserRouter\>  
in web browsers or a <StaticRouter\> for server rendering.
