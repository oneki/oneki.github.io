**Oneki.js** is a React framework based of the following components: 
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
* [Redux Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) 
* [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction) 

The goal of **Oneki.js** is to propose a framework on top of these librairies that hides most of the complexity.
Therefore, the developer can built more quickly powerful webapps respecting the best practices.

## Installation

Create a new React application with **[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)** and add **onekijs** as a dependency:
```javascript
// npm install -g yarn
yarn create react-app my-app
cd my-app
yarn add onekijs
yarn install
```

## Next steps
[Create your first basic application](basic-app)
> To fully master the framework, be sure to read the documentation of 
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
* [Redux Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) 

> **Oneki.js** has an opinionated approach on how to use these librairies and tries to remove a lot of boilerplate, but it's important to understand how it works underneath.
